## Project Description

The App is written in React to organise your photos with AWS facial Rekognition. After authorising, you can upload a album of your favorite photos(of people) and then add profiles for faces. The app will then find mathches of all of your recognised profiles and filter them accordingly.<br/>
There is still alot that can be done with this app but at its current state it accomplishes what I was trying to do.<br/>
This is the frontend repo. The backend API and AWS LAMBDA scripts can found at [here](https://github.com/EstianD/face-watch-backend)<br/><br/>
